## AND and BETWEEN

### Questions

1. Write a query that returns all the orders where the ```standard_qty``` is over 1000, the ```poster_qty``` is 0, and the ```gloss_qty``` is 0. 

2. Using the ```accounts``` table, find all the companies whose names do not start with 'C' and end with 's'.

3. When you use the BETWEEN operator in SQL, do the results include the values of your endpoints, or not? Figure out the answer to this important question by writing a query that displays the order date and ```gloss_qty``` data for all orders where ```gloss_qty``` is between 24 and 29. Then look at your output to see if the BETWEEN operator included the begin and end values or not.

4. Use the ```web_events``` table to find all information regarding individuals who were contacted via the ```organic``` or ```adwords``` channels, and started their account at any point in 2016, sorted from newest to oldest.
